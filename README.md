# eurovision-voting-jupyter-notebooks
 My Jupyter notebooks regarding Eurovision voting, in the `notebook` folder:
 * `agree.ipynb`, which explores the disagreement between jury and public votes in Eurovision (2016~2019)
* `collusion.ipynb`, which explores favouritism and collusion (two-way favouritism) between Eurovision participants.
